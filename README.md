## 🎯 Overview

This repository provides a complete toolkit for solving graph-related problems in Java. It includes:

- **Multiple graph representations** (adjacency list, weighted graphs)

## 📊 Graph Representations

### 1. Adjacency List (Unweighted)
```java
Graph graph = new Graph(5, false); // 5 vertices, undirected
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
```

### 2. Weighted Adjacency List
```java
WeightedGraph wGraph = new WeightedGraph(5, true); // 5 vertices, directed
wGraph.addEdge(0, 1, 10); // Edge from 0 to 1 with weight 10
```

## 🔧 Algorithms Implemented

### Traversal Algorithms
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) | Shortest path in unweighted graph |
| DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) | Cycle detection, topological sort |

### Shortest Path Algorithms
| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Dijkstra | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) | Single source, non-negative weights |
| Floyd-Warshall | O(V³) | O(V²) | All pairs shortest paths |
| Bellman-Ford | O(VE) | O(V) | Negative weights, cycle detection |

### Advanced Algorithms

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Graph Operations
```java
// Create an undirected graph with 5 vertices
Graph graph = new Graph(5, false);

// Add edges
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(2, 3);

// Perform traversals
graph.bfs(0);           // BFS from vertex 0
graph.dfsRecursive(0);  // DFS from vertex 0

// Check properties
boolean connected = graph.isConnected();
boolean hasCycle = graph.hasCycleUndirected();
```

### Shortest Path Finding
```java
// Create weighted graph
WeightedGraph wGraph = new WeightedGraph(5, false);
wGraph.addEdge(0, 1, 2);
wGraph.addEdge(1, 2, 3);
wGraph.addEdge(0, 3, 6);

// Find shortest distances from vertex 0
Map<Integer, Integer> distances = wGraph.dijkstra(0);

// Find specific shortest path
List<Integer> path = wGraph.getShortestPath(0, 4);
```

### Advanced Problem Solving
```java
// Find connected components
List<List<Integer>> components = GraphProblems.findConnectedComponents(graph);

// Check if graph is bipartite
boolean isBipartite = GraphProblems.isBipartite(graph);

// Find bridges and articulation points
List<int[]> bridges = GraphProblems.findBridges(graph);

=== GRAPH DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS DEMO ===

1. BASIC GRAPH OPERATIONS
========================
Undirected Graph:
Vertex 0: 1 2 
Vertex 1: 0 3 
Vertex 2: 0 4 
...

BFS traversal starting from vertex 0: 0 1 2 3 4 5 
DFS (Recursive) traversal starting from vertex 0: 0 1 3 4 2 5 
```

## 🎯 Problem-Solving Approach

### Step 1: Identify the Problem Type
- **Traversal**: Use BFS/DFS
- **Shortest Path**: Choose appropriate algorithm based on constraints
- **Connectivity**: Use DFS or Union-Find
- **Optimization**: Consider MST or dynamic programming approaches

### Step 2: Choose the Right Algorithm
- **Unweighted shortest path**: BFS
- **Weighted shortest path (non-negative)**: Dijkstra
- **Weighted shortest path (with negatives)**: Bellman-Ford
- **All-pairs shortest path**: Floyd-Warshall
- **Minimum spanning tree**: Kruskal's or Prim's

### Step 3: Consider Edge Cases
- Disconnected graphs
- Self-loops
- Multiple edges between same vertices
- Negative weight cycles

### Step 4: Optimize for Constraints
- Small graphs (V ≤ 100): Floyd-Warshall acceptable
- Large sparse graphs: Adjacency list + Dijkstra
- Dense graphs: Consider adjacency matrix
